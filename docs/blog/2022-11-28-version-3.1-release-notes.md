Version 3.1 of [Foal](https://foalts.org/) is out! Here are the improvements that it brings:

<!--truncate-->

## New `foal upgrade` command

This command allows you to upgrade all `@foal/*` dependencies and dev dependencies to a given version.

*Examples*
```bash
foal upgrade # upgrade to the latest version
foal upgrade 3.0.0
foal upgrade "~3.0.0"
```

## Social authentication supports subdomains

If you're using multiple subdomains domains to handle social authentication, you can now do so by specifying a custom cookie domain in the configuration:

```yaml
settings:
  social:
    cookie:
      domain: foalts.org
```

## Regression on OpenAPI keyword "example" has been fixed

In version 3.0, using the keyword `example` in an validation object was raising an error. This has been fixed.

## `.env` files support whitespaces

Whitespaces around the equal symbol are now allowed:

```bash
FOO_BAR_WITH_WHITESPACES_AROUND_THE_NAME = hello you
```

## Value of the `Strict-Transport-Security` header has been increased

It has been increased from 15,552,000 to 31,536,000.
