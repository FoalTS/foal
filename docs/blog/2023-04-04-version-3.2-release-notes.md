Version 3.2 of [Foal](https://foalts.org/) is out! Here are the improvements that it brings:

<!--truncate-->

## New package `@foal/password`

The `foal/password` package, which was removed in v3.0, has been re-added. It offers an `isCommon` method to check if a password is too common:

```typescript
const isPasswordTooCommon = await isCommon(password);
```

## Read the controller and the controller method names in request contexts

The `Context` and `WebsocketContext` have two new properties:


 | Name | Type | Description |
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | `controllerName` | `string` | The name of the controller class. |
 | `controllerMethodName` | `string` | The name of the controller method. |
