Version 4.0 of [Foal](https://foalts.org/) is out!

<!--truncate-->

## Description

The goals of this major release are to
- support the latest active versions of Node (18 and 20) and update all internal dependencies to their latest major versions
- facilitate framework maintenance.

Full details can be found [here](https://github.com/FoalTS/foal/issues/1223).

## Migration guide

- Run `npx foal upgrade`.
- Version 16 of Node is not supported anymore. Upgrade to version 18 or version 20.
- Support of MariaDB has been dropped.
- If you use any of these dependencies, upgrade `typeorm` to v0.3.17, `graphql` to v16, `type-graphql` to v2, `class-validator` to v0.14, `mongodb` to v5 and `@socket.io/redis-adapter` to v8.
- If you use both TypeORM and `MongoDBStore`, there is no need anymore to maintain two versions of `mongodb`. You can use version 5 of `mongodb` dependency.
- If you use `@foal/socket.io` with redis, install `socket.io-adapter`.
- Support for `better-sqlite` driver has been dropped. Use the `sqlite3` driver instead. In DB configuration, use `type: 'sqlite'` instead of `type: 'better-sqlite3'`.
- In your project dependencies, upgrade `@types/node` to v18.11.9.
- If you use TypeORM with MongoDB, for the entities definitions, rename `import { ObjectID } from 'typeorm';` to `import { ObjectId } from 'typeorm';`
