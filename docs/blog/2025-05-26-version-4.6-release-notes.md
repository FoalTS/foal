Version 4.6 of [Foal](https://foalts.org/) is out!

<!--truncate-->

## Security update

This release is a security update that removes the deprecated `X-XSS-Protection` header. This header was previously used to enable the browser's XSS filtering, but it is now considered obsolete as modern browsers have built-in XSS protection mechanisms. In some cases, this header can also create XSS vulnerabilities in otherwise safe websites.

## How to update

To update to version 4.6, run:

```bash
npx foal upgrade 4.6
```

No code changes are required.
