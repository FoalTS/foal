# Linting and Code Style

FoalTS comes up with a pre configuration for the [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)) [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/).

> *TSLint is an extensible static analysis tool that checks TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors. It is widely supported across modern editors & build systems and can be customized with your own lint rules, configurations, and formatters.*

This configuration is stored in the json file `tslint.json`.

You can run the linting with this command:
```sh
npm run lint
```
