# Get started

In this tutorial you will learn how to build and run a simple FoalTS application using the FoalTS CLI.

This command line interface lets you quickly create files and build, run and test your code without any further configuration.

## 1. Set up the Development Environment

First of all you need to set up your development environment before creating a new project.

Install [Node.Js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if they are not already installed on your host.

> FoalTS requires version 8 of nodejs or higher.

Then install the FoalTS CLI.

```shell
npm install -g @foal/cli
```

## 2. Create a new project

You are now ready to create your first project.

```shell
foal createapp my-app
```

This command creates a new directory `my-app` with the source code of your project along with its config files and build tools.

Go to the directory and install the dependencies.

```shell
cd my-app
npm install
```

## 3. Serve the application

Start the server.

```shell
npm run develop
```

Open your browser on `http://localhost:3000` and find our welcoming message!

> `npm run develop` starts the **development server**. It watches at your files and automatically compiles and reloads your code. You donâ€™t need to restart the server each time you make code changes. Note that it is only intended to be used in development, do not use it on production.

> **Port 3000 already in use?**
>
> You can modify in `config/settings.js` which port the application is using.
