In this tutorial you will learn how to create a basic web application with FoalTS. The demo application is a simple to-do list with which users can view, create and delete their tasks.

> **Requirements:**
>
> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 18 or greater

## Create a New Project

First you need to install globaly the *Command Line Interface (CLI)* of FoalTS. It will help you create a new project and generate files all along your development.

```sh
npm install -g @foal/cli
```

Then create a new application.

```sh
foal createapp my-app
```

This command generates a new directory with the basic structure of the new application. It also installs all the dependencies. Let's look at what `createapp` created:

```shell
my-app/
  config/
  node_modules/
  public/
  src/
    app/
    e2e/
    scripts/
  package.json
  tsconfig.*.json
  .eslintrc.js
```

The outer `my-app` root directory is just a container for your project.
- The `config/` directory contains configuration files for your different environments (production, test, development, e2e, etc).
- The `node_modules/` directory contains all the prod and dev dependencies of your project.
- The static files are located in the `public/` directory. They are usually images, CSS and client JavaScript files and are served directly when the server is running.
- The `src/` directory contains all the source code of the application.
  - The inner `app/` directory includes the components of your server (controllers, services and hooks).
  - End-to-end tests are located in the `e2e/` directory.
  - The inner `scripts/` folder contains scripts intended to be called from the command line (ex: create-user).
- The `package.json` lists the dependencies and commands of the project.
- The `tsconfig.*.json` files list the TypeScript compiler configuration for each `npm` command.
- Finally the linting configuration can be found in the `.eslintrc.js` file.

> **TypeScript**
>
> The language used to develop a FoalTS application is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. The benefits of using TypeScript are many, but in summary, the language provides great tools and the future features of JavaScript.

## Start The Server

Let's verify that the FoalTS project works. Run the following commands:

```
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

You've started the development server.

> The **development server** watches at your files and automatically compiles and reloads your code. You donâ€™t need to restart the server each time you make code changes. Note that it is only intended to be used in development, do not use it on production.


> **Port 3001 already in use?**
>
> You can define in `config/default.json` which port the application is using.

Go to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser. You should see the text *Welcome on board*.

Congratulations, you now have a server running!
