# Linting & Code Style

FoalTS comes up with a pre configuration for the linter [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/).

> _TSLint is an extensible static analysis tool that checks TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors. It is widely supported across modern editors & build systems and can be customized with your own lint rules, configurations, and formatters._

This configuration is stored in the json file `tslint.json`.

You can run the linting with this command:

```bash
npm run lint
```
